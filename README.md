# vm-frontend

Welcome to the Tosidrop VM Frontend!

## About
The code is split into two projects, an Express API which serves as a backend
for the frontend, and a React UI which is built into static assets.

This is intended for use via Docker.

Within this repository is an Ansible playbook to install Docker on the local
machine and run the containers.

## Usage

```bash
./runme.sh
```
